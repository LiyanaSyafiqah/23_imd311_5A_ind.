<h3>WATTPAD</h3>
<div class="box9">
    <p>My hobby is reading novels. Compared to books, I prefer reading novels online rather than printed novels. 
        For me, novel books are very complicated to carry everywhere while the application "Wattpad" has made my work easier.
        Wattpad is a free social-storytelling app which enables users to connect with and read content by writers from around the world, 
        as well as creating and sharing their own original stories. With over 90 million users, it is a popular platform with those 
        who enjoy reading and writing, especially teenagers and young adults. Wattpad has stories available in more than 50 languages,and nearly 300,000 writers from 35 countries take part every year in the largest writing competition, The Watty Awards.
        Furthermore, I like to read novels with elements of romance, fantasy and violence. Other than that, Wattpad has 
        positive impacts on students' language skills, writing skills, comprehension, and reading habits, as well as fostering an interest 
        in literature and developing essential life skills such as self-reflection, motivation, creative imagination, maturity, 
        and a love of reading.
